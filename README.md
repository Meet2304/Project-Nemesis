<h1 align="center">Project Nemesis</h1>

<p align = 'justify'>
  In ancient mythology, Nemesis was the goddess of balance and justice—restoring order wherever arrogance and chaos reigned. She wasn’t a symbol of revenge, but of accountability.
<br>
Today, our courts face a different kind of imbalance: delays, inefficiencies, and lack of transparency. Project Nemesis is our answer—not with swords, but with software.
<br>
This initiative aims to transform Gujarat’s court system into a streamlined, accessible, and intelligent platform—where justice is not just delivered, but delivered right.
<br>
Nemesis isn’t just a name.
It’s a mission to make justice efficient, visible, and fair.
