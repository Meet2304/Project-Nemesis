# Feature Specification: Landing Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-feature-landing-page`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build the landing page for Project Nemesis, a professional, trustworthy introductory page targeting investors and government stakeholders; must clearly communicate vision: transparent, efficient, accessible justice system; emphasize transparency, efficiency, accessibility, trust, civic professionalism."

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What tone should the hero mission statement adopt to best align with stakeholder expectations? → A: Professional civic (clear, plain, authoritative)
- Q: How should the System Overview be presented on the landing page? → A: Structured textual list (headings + short blurbs)
- Q: Should we include an initial analytics hook placeholder now, and if so what scope? → A: Console logging stub behind env flag
- Q: What is the acceptable maximum initial uncompressed hero section HTML + critical CSS transfer size target (performance guardrail)? → A: ≤25 KB
- Q: Do we need to plan for future multi-language support in structure now (affects copy organization and potential i18n scaffold)? → A: Lightweight i18n scaffolding (keys + single locale)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A visiting government stakeholder or potential investor lands on the root URL and immediately understands Project Nemesis' mission: delivering a transparent, efficient, and accessible court management platform. They can scan concise value pillars, view a high‑level system overview, and identify next actions (request a demo, read vision summary, or contact team) without distraction.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an anonymous visitor on a modern desktop browser, **When** they load the landing page, **Then** the hero section with mission statement and primary call-to-action is visible within first viewport without horizontal scrolling.
2. **Given** a screen reader user, **When** they navigate landmarks, **Then** they encounter ordered: skip link → header (navigation) → main (hero, value pillars, overview) → footer (contact/disclaimer) with descriptive labels.
3. **Given** a mobile device (≤390px width), **When** the page loads, **Then** navigation collapses into an accessible menu button with visible focus states and no content overlap.
4. **Given** a user with reduced vision, **When** they inspect color contrast, **Then** all text vs background combinations meet WCAG 2.1 AA thresholds (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text).
5. **Given** the page initial load, **When** network is slow (simulated slow 4G), **Then** above‑the‑fold content renders without waiting for lazy‑loaded illustrative/diagram components.

### Edge Cases
- Very long stakeholder titles or mission tagline does not wrap poorly nor overflow container.
- JavaScript disabled: critical mission text and basic navigation links still render (progressive enhancement baseline, minimal acceptable HTML structure). 
- Screen reader rotor/landmarks: exactly one main region and one nav region exposed.
- High zoom (200%): layout reflows without requiring horizontal scrolling.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a hero section containing: project name, mission sentence, supporting tagline, and a primary call-to-action button.
- **FR-002**: System MUST present three to five value pillars (Transparency, Efficiency, Accessibility, Trust / Accountability) each with heading + short descriptive text.
- **FR-003**: System MUST include an accessible navigation bar with logical tab order and visible focus states.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a skip-to-content link that becomes visible on keyboard focus.
- **FR-005**: System MUST include a high-level system overview presented as a structured textual list: each core domain (Case Intake, Scheduling, Digital Records, Public Access) rendered with a heading and ≤30 word blurb using semantic list markup (<ul>/<li> or <dl>) and appropriate heading levels; no diagram in MVP.
- **FR-006**: System MUST include a footer with contact action (e.g., mailto or placeholder), legal/disclaimer text, and version reference.
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard only.
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure all text content meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast.
- **FR-009**: System MUST lazy-load the non-critical system overview component to optimize initial performance.
- **FR-010**: System MUST expose structured metadata (title, description, Open Graph basic tags) for improved sharing/context.
- **FR-011**: System MUST render responsively across standard breakpoints (mobile-first strategy).
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide an initial analytics integration stub that is a no-op console logging wrapper gated behind an environment flag to avoid production noise and MUST NOT block rendering.
- **FR-013**: System MUST keep cumulative layout shift minimal (no layout jumps on lazy content load).
- **FR-014**: Primary CTA MUST be clearly distinguishable and programmatically labeled.
- **FR-015**: System MUST prevent duplicate navigation landmark regions.
- **FR-016**: System MUST set language attribute on root document (e.g., <html lang="en").
- **FR-017**: System MUST include canonical link in metadata.
- **FR-018**: System MUST ensure hero text still readable at 200% zoom (no clipped overflow).
- **FR-019**: System MUST document any future extension zones (e.g., news feed placeholder) in code comments without implementing them now.
- **FR-020**: System MUST avoid introducing third-party UI libraries beyond Tailwind during this feature implementation.
- **FR-021**: Hero mission copy MUST follow a professional civic tone: clear, plain, authoritative (no marketing hyperbole, no informal language).
- **FR-022**: Analytics stub MUST only log when `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS_STUB === 'true'` and export a `track(eventName:string, data?:Record<string,unknown>)` function that becomes a no-op otherwise.
- **FR-023**: Initial uncompressed combined hero HTML + critical CSS (inline or blocking) MUST be ≤25 KB as measured from a production build; exceeding this fails acceptance.
- **FR-024**: Implement lightweight i18n scaffolding: all user-visible landing page copy sourced from a single English locale JSON (e.g., `content/i18n/en/landing.json`) with stable keys; no runtime locale switching yet.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Value Pillar**: Title, shortDescription, icon (optional decorative), order.
- **System Domain Highlight**: name, summary, lazyLoad (boolean), position.
- **Locale Copy Resource**: key (string), value (string), namespace (landing), locale ("en").
